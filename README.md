This is memory game using React technology.


1. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.

2. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.

3. The application should keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.



## Folder Structure

After creation, your project should look like this:

```
Clicky_Game/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
  src/
    App.css
    App.js
    index.css
    index.js
```

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

You can delete or rename the other files.

### `npm start`
